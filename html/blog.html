		    		<h2>International Bug Fix for Shine</h2>
		    		<p>Shine user experiencing frequent crashes should try the following:</p>
		    		<p>Navigate to Settings -> General -> International -> Region Format. Change your region format temporarily, then switch back. Shine should no longer crash.</p>					
		    		<p>This seems to be a funky bug that only affects a small number of users, mostly in the UK. We can't reproduce the issue on our end, but will try to isolate the issue and submit a fix soon.</p>

					<h2>The Silliest Little Bug</h2>
					<p>Anyone noticed that Shine is a bit of an optimist? No? Good. Stop reading.</p>
					<p>But for those of you who might've wondered why Shine is predicting endless sun on gloomy, cloud-filled days, it's because we here at AppThat really goofed... we just discovered the silliest little bug! Our weather conditions algorithm is currently using wind speed values for cloud cover. Sigh.</p>
					<p>We've fixed the issue in 1.1; until then, enjoy the (virtual) sun! :)</p>

					<h2>Shine 1.1 Will Be Even Better</h2>
					<p>Instead of sitting on features and waiting around for Apple to approve Shine 1.1, we decided to resubmit our binary and give our fine users an even slicker update. In addition to those items listed in the previous post, here's what's new:</p>
					<p>LOCATION NAMES<br/>
					Shine 1.0 assigned names to locations based on metropolitan area. Hence places like Canton, MA were labeled as Boston, MA even though weather data would come from a Canton weather station. Shine 1.1 improves location nomenclature dramatically.</p>
					<p>INTERFACE<br/>
					Automatically return to the weather view after a location change<br/>
					Metric wind speed is now displayed as km/h<br/>
					Settings icon has been standardized<br/>
					Improved error alerts<br/>
					New app icon</p>
					<p>*** A note about international support: Currently, Shine gathers extended weather data from the National Weather Service (US only). However, we plan to introduce full international support within the next few weeks. Stay tuned!</p>
