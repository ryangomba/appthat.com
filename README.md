# AppThat.com

Website for my old app development company AppThat, preserved here and deployed to [appthat.ryangomba.com](https://appthat.ryangomba.com).

### Running

You can run locally using a simple HTTP server, such as Node's `http-server`:

yarn global add http-server
http-server html --port 8080
